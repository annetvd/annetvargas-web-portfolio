1
00:01.433 --> 00:02.850
Web platform

2
00:04.583 --> 00:08.733
The platform has five different types of users:

3
00:08.850 --> 00:13.816
accounting, statistics, auxiliary, packer, and administrator.

4
00:15.433 --> 00:18.850
The accounting user has access to the catalog of banks,

5
00:18.900 --> 00:22.766
bank accounts, fees, packers, regimes, and types of contribution.

6
00:23.300 --> 00:25.650
However, the main catalog is that of packers,

7
00:26.366 --> 00:29.533
as many processes of the platform depend on it.

8
00:29.833 --> 00:34.900
Once a pack is registered, its user is automatically registered,

9
00:34.910 --> 00:39.533
and an automated email is sent to activate it.

10
00:40.400 --> 00:43.350
Additionally, when a pack is registered,

11
00:43.400 --> 00:49.566
its balance is set to zero and updated as
invoices and payments are registered.

12
00:50.550 --> 01:00.053
From the packers catalog query, it's possible to search for a
specific pack or classify it based on its location, among other things.

13
01:00.850 --> 01:05.950
All catalogs, as well as all reports and all platform information,

14
01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
can be downloaded as CSV files that can be opened in Excel,

15
01:11.050 --> 01:16.850
allowing the information to continue to be
processed by association employees.

16
01:17.150 --> 01:24.850
Finally, the modification form of the packers'
catalog allows updating their data,

17
01:24.900 --> 01:27.950
except for the RFC and SADER registration.

18
01:28.000 --> 01:36.450
The main purpose of the platform for the accounting user is
to maintain internal control of the association's income.

19
01:36.500 --> 01:44.450
To streamline the registration of an invoice in the platform, it is necessary
to select the XML and PDF files already generated for the invoice.

20
01:44.500 --> 01:51.200
This way, the platform automatically obtains the data, records it,

21
01:51.250 --> 01:57.000
uploads the selected files to the server, and
sends them to the corresponding packer.

22
01:57.050 --> 02:03.300
In the query table, there are three buttons:
the first two open the files uploaded to the server,

23
02:03.350 --> 02:07.850
and the last button, on the right, indicates whether
the automatic email was sent correctly.

24
02:07.950 --> 02:14.000
A green color indicates it wasn't sent, while black indicates it was.
Similarly, it is possible to resend it with this button.

25
02:14.250 --> 02:18.150
Finally, the platform also records the cancellation of invoices.

26
02:18.200 --> 02:22.350
First, the specific folio is searched,
and then the justification is entered.

27
02:22.550 --> 02:28.000
The platform automatically obtains the
date and records the cancellation.

28
02:28.350 --> 02:33.200
Invoices increase the balance of the packers, 
while payments decrease it.

29
02:33.250 --> 02:41.150
To register a payment, a packer is selected, 
and the platform displays its pending invoices.

30
02:41.300 --> 02:48.100
Then, the corresponding XML file to one
of these pending invoices is selected,

31
02:48.105 --> 02:53.250
and the platform automatically retrieves
the data just like with the invoices.

32
02:53.850 --> 03:00.450
The platform also selects the association's bank
account where the packer deposits the money.

33
03:00.500 --> 03:08.150
This way, it records the account already registered in
the catalog of packers from which the payment was made

34
03:08.400 --> 03:11.150
and the account it was deposited into.

35
03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Similar to the invoice query table, the payment table 
allows for the review of files uploaded to the server

36
03:18.050 --> 03:22.150
and the resending of automatic emails for each record.

37
03:23.150 --> 03:28.650
Below is an example of the automated emails sent by the platform.

38
03:28.950 --> 03:35.350
In these emails, you can see a message with
the invoice folio in the case of invoices,

39
03:35.550 --> 03:43.700
along with the corresponding month for the contribution
and the PDF and XML files uploaded to the server.

40
03:45.050 --> 03:55.550
On the other hand, for the payment emails, the PDD number and the
uploaded files are also included. 

41
03:55.700 --> 04:06.350
Below are the income reports. The first one is the general income report,
which gathers all invoices and payments within a specified period.

42
04:06.550 --> 04:11.400
Invoices represent charges, and payments represent credits.

43
04:11.450 --> 04:17.000
Consequently, a detailed report of the total
charges and credits is obtained.

44
04:17.050 --> 04:25.000
This report can be generated for each individual
packer or overall for all of them.

45
04:25.450 --> 04:37.250
Additionally, it can be exported to a PDF file with the information displayed
in the query table and automatically sent to the selected packer.

46
04:37.550 --> 04:44.000
On the other hand, the income summary report uses
the same algorithm as the previous report

47
04:44.050 --> 04:50.700
but queries monthly and only displays the totals for each packer.

48
04:50.800 --> 05:02.850
It's also possible to query by types of contributions or for all
registered invoices and payments, generating a PDF report.

49
05:03.150 --> 05:12.450
Finally, there's the account statement report, which compiles
all invoice records per packer or all packers,

50
05:12.500 --> 05:15.800
each representing a monthly contribution.

51
05:15.950 --> 05:24.750
These reports compare exported kilograms, contributions automatically
calculated by the platform, and invoice amounts.

52
05:25.200 --> 05:34.850
It's possible to generate the report in PDF
format and automatically send it via email.

53
05:35.100 --> 05:41.550
The automatic email includes personalized report
data based on the selected parameters.

54
05:41.950 --> 05:52.250
To conclude, the contributions report conducts a monthly query of
exported kilograms per packer and calculates the monthly contributions

55
05:52.300 --> 05:58.450
by multiplying these kilograms by the registered fee for
that month, which in some cases may be more than one.

56
05:58.750 --> 06:04.450
Finally, the invoice number corresponding to each contribution is displayed,

57
06:04.500 --> 06:08.150
in the case of those that have already been invoiced, so
that the user can identify those that are still pending.

58
06:08.750 --> 06:20.150
This query can be filtered by packers that do invoice to
identify outstanding contributions or by all packers.

59
06:20.950 --> 06:28.100
On the other hand, the statistician user has access to
the catalogs of fees, packers, states, municipalities,

60
06:28.150 --> 06:34.450
officials, countries, entry ports, third parties,
third-party specialists, and transports.

61
06:34.550 --> 06:40.450
These catalogs are necessary to validate registration
and certificate replacement forms.

62
06:40.550 --> 06:51.150
They also validate that the selected date is within the corresponding
season, which begins in June and ends in May of the following year.

63
06:52.200 --> 07:00.500
The main objective of these and many more validations is to ensure
that there are no errors in the registration of certificates,

64
07:00.600 --> 07:05.450
as these are the main source of information for the platform.

65
07:05.550 --> 07:10.150
They are used to calculate monthly contributions
and generate all statistics.

66
07:10.750 --> 07:16.250
Now, the current form is the certificate cancellation
form. To cancel a certificate,

67
07:16.300 --> 07:22.300
first, a search is made based on its CFI
folio, and a justification is recorded.

68
07:22.850 --> 07:30.500
On the other hand, certificate replacement works similarly.
A search is conducted, the data is obtained,

69
07:30.850 --> 07:38.400
and the platform allows registering a new one based on this information
without having to fill out the complete form again.

70
07:38.950 --> 07:44.650
This way, only the fields with errors or differences are modified,

71
07:44.950 --> 07:50.100
and the justification for canceling the
certificate to be replaced is recorded.

72
07:50.250 --> 07:57.300
A certificate that is canceled is no longer valid
and is not considered by the association,

73
07:57.550 --> 08:02.850
however, a certificate with an original
status or replacement status is.

74
08:03.350 --> 08:06.850
Now, the query is displayed here. With this,

75
08:06.900 --> 08:12.900
it's possible to filter the data by status, time
period, type of export, among other things.

76
08:12.950 --> 08:18.650
Like the catalogs, it can be exported in CSV files.

77
08:18.950 --> 08:26.250
To achieve this result, a Bootstrap library
was implemented to use a dynamic table.

78
08:26.350 --> 08:33.700
This table indicates how many records are being displayed and
how many records there are in total, among other things.

79
08:34.250 --> 08:43.250
For this user, it's also possible to access the contribution report,
but as we've seen before, I won't explain here what we're seeing.

80
08:43.900 --> 08:52.950
This is the report of historical statistics, which presents
two types of charts: a bar chart and a line chart.

81
08:53.000 --> 09:03.900
It's possible to consult any year within the historical data of the
association and download an automatic report in PDF format.

82
09:03.950 -->  09:13.350
This report displays statistics in the form of charts and
the data for each month and year in a table format.

83
09:14.350 --> 09:23.950
Additionally, there are monthly statistics that
show the overall exports by destination.

84
09:24.350 --> 09:31.600
These are presented in bar charts and pie charts. Furthermore,
the vessels registered in that month are also displayed.

85
09:32.700 --> 09:38.450
In this case, what we are currently viewing on
the screen are the statistics by packer,

86
09:38.550 --> 09:41.800
which are exactly the same as the previous statistics,

87
09:41.850 --> 09:46.850
with the only difference being that here the
data of a specific packer are displayed.

88
09:47.250 --> 09:55.550
Similarly to the previous example, the PDF report presents
tables with the data for each destination.

89
09:56.050 --> 10:01.325
Lastly, there are the statistics by season, which compare two seasons.

90
10:01.450 --> 10:08.850
These are presented in individual charts, one for
each season, and include two comparative charts:

91
10:09.000 --> 10:15.630
one bar chart and one line chart. Any season can be
chosen, but the default is to load the last two.

92
10:16.080 --> 10:28.200
In the PDF report, in addition to the exports for each month, the
exports for each month by destination for each season are shown.

93
10:28.450 --> 10:31.290
This concludes the functionality for the statistics user.

94
10:32.250 --> 10:42.300
On this screen, the menu for the auxiliary statistician user is presented.
It contains some of the catalogs available to the statistician user type,

95
10:42.650 --> 10:50.150
as well as access to certificates, whether for
registration, cancellation, or replacement.

96
10:50.200 --> 11:01.900
However, the auxiliary statistician user type only supports certificate
capture and doesn’t have access to contributions or statistical inquiries.

97
11:02.950 --> 11:10.950
The user of type packer doesn’t have administrative permissions
but can consult the association's statistics.

98
11:11.000 --> 11:26.020
The difference lies in the monthly statistics per packer.
The packer user can’t choose which packer to consult,

99
11:26.100 --> 11:35.110
as this data is confidential among the packers. Therefore,
the user can only view their own statistics.

100
11:35.350 --> 11:43.500
Additionally, the system help is displayed, accessible
to all users and personalized for each one.

101
11:43.900 --> 11:50.880
Clicking on any of the accordions brings up a screen with each step,

102
11:51.000 --> 11:55.905
warnings, and recommendations for the corresponding form.

103
11:56.300 --> 12:08.480
Finally, there is the user of type administrator, who has access to all
areas of the system and can register users who will be using it.

104
12:08.820 --> 12:14.950
This screen displays the user registration form, which,
like the packers' catalog registration form,

105
12:15.000 --> 12:22.180
sends an automated email to activate the account. The administrator
user also has some controls to manage the system,

106
12:22.250 --> 12:26.470
such as error logging, backup, and database restoration.

107
12:27.970 --> 12:37.750
Now, I'm showing the process to reset a user's password.
First, the user's email address is entered,

108
12:37.880 --> 12:47.470
and then the platform sends an automated
email containing the activation link.

109
12:47.600 --> 13:00.050
This link includes two pieces of information: the user's ID and a token,
which is an activation code that validates the password change.

110
13:00.380 --> 13:08.660
This screen displays the form responsible
for verifying if the link is valid.

111
13:08.900 --> 13:16.560
In this case, an expired link is shown, which is
no longer valid for changing the password.

112
13:17.760 --> 13:19.650
Mobile App

113
13:20.560 --> 13:29.550
The users who have access to this application are: the administrator
user, who can access the statistics and the agenda;

114
13:29.580 --> 13:36.916
the accounting user who can access the agenda, and
the executive user who can view the statistics.

115
13:37.650 --> 13:40.933
This is the main screen of the mobile application.

116
13:41.500 --> 13:48.050
Here, the login process takes place, and it verifies that
the user has the necessary permissions to access.

117
13:48.533 --> 13:53.966
It's important to note that users of types statistician,
assistant, and packer do not have access.

118
13:54.883 --> 14:03.766
All this process is carried out on the server, and the queries are
constantly updated once the user logs into the application.

119
14:04.466 --> 14:10.606
Here I'm showing the main menu, the agenda menu, and the statistics menu.

120
14:10.866 --> 14:17.966
The administrator has access to all functions available in the
application, and the home button redirects to the main menu.

121
14:18.433 --> 14:25.650
Regarding user permissions, the accounting
user has access to the agenda menu.

122
14:25.830 --> 14:29.846
This menu includes all packers and displays

123
14:29.900 --> 14:37.700
the data registered in the packers catalog in the
web application, which is consulted in real-time.

124
14:37.883 --> 14:45.106
Additionally, it shows the balances, which are updated
each time invoices and payments are registered.

125
14:45.370 --> 14:49.845
The catalog of suppliers registered in the database is also included.

126
14:50.300 --> 14:57.000
It's important to mention that this catalog doesn’t belong to my project,
but it has been included to meet the needs of the accounting user.

127
14:58.516 --> 15:07.883
Also, there's the executive user, who has access to the statistics.
These include general statistics and statistics per packer.

128
15:08.400 --> 15:17.733
The general statistics display historical data using
the same algorithm as presented in the web platform.

129
15:18.466 --> 15:28.716
Additionally, here I'm showing how, when rotating the
phone horizontally, the query parameters are retained.

130
15:29.266 --> 15:36.683
It's important to remember that in Android, activities
are restarted each time the orientation changes.

131
15:36.883 --> 15:46.563
Now, the monthly statistics are presented, obtained
in the same way as those on the web platform.

132
15:46.750 --> 15:49.883
These statistics display exports by destination.

133
15:50.450 --> 15:58.566
When rotating the phone horizontally, the menu at
the top is hidden to view the graphs comfortably.

134
15:58.766 --> 16:09.076
The library used to generate them allows interactive zooming.
Additionally, in horizontal mode, queries can also be performed.

135
16:09.833 --> 16:17.950
Now, the statistics per packer use exactly the
same algorithm as the previous statistics,

136
16:18.516 --> 16:25.450
with the only difference being that here you can select a specific packer.

137
16:25.500 --> 16:35.500
In fact, historical statistics per packer are exclusive to the mobile
application, as they are not available on the web platform.

138
16:35.600 --> 16:40.633
Finally, there are monthly statistics per packer,
which are available on the web platform.

139
16:40.683 --> 16:44.550
To close the application, simply click on the exit button.

140
16:44.583 --> 16:49.200
It also closes automatically when it goes into the background.
